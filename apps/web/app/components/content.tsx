          <AccordionTrigger>Daily Auctions?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            **The Objects Auction Contract will act as a self-sufficient Object generation and distribution mechanism, auctioning one Object every 1 hour, forever. 100% of auction proceeds (obc &&Sui) are automatically deposited in the Objects DAO treasury, where they are governed by Object owners.**
            **Each time an auction is settled, the settlement transaction will also cause a new Object to be minted and a new 1 hour auction to begin.**
            **While settlement is most heavily incentivized for the winning bidder, it can be triggered by anyone, allowing the system to trustlessly auction Objects as long as Sui is operational and there are interested bidders.**

          <AccordionTrigger>Objects DAO?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Objects DAO utilizes a fork of Compound Governance and is the main governing body of the Objects ecosystem. The Objects DAO treasury receives 100% of OBJ proceeds from daily Object auctions. Each Object is an irrevocable member of Objects DAO and entitled to one vote in all governance matters. Object votes are non-transferable (if you sell your Object the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to someone else as long as you own your Object.

          <AccordionContent>
            **The proposal veto right was initially envisioned as a temporary solution to the problem of ‘51% attacks’ on the Objects DAO treasury. While Objecters initially believed that a healthy distribution of Objects would be sufficient protection for the DAO, a more complete understanding of the incentives and risks has led to consensus within the Objecters, the Objects Foundation, and the wider community that a more robust game-theoretic solution should be implemented before the right is removed.**

            **The Objects community has undertaken a preliminary exploration of proposal veto alternatives (‘rage quit’ etc.), but it is now clear that this is a difficult problem that will require significantly more research, development and testing before a satisfactory solution can be implemented.**

            **Consequently, the Objects Foundation anticipates being the steward of the veto power until Objects DAO is ready to implement an alternative, and therefore wishes to clarify the conditions under which it would exercise this power.**

            **The Objects Foundation considers the veto an emergency power that should not be exercised in the normal course of business. The Objects Foundation will veto proposals that introduce non-trivial legal or existential risks to the Objects DAO or the Objects Foundation, including (but not necessarily limited to) proposals that:**

            **unequally withdraw the treasury for personal gain voters to facilitate withdraws of the treasury for personal gain attempt to alter Object auction cadence to maintain or acquire a voting majority make upgrades to critical smart contracts without undergoing an audit**

            **There are unfortunately no algorithmic solutions for making these determinations in advance (if there were, the veto would not be required), and proposals must be considered on a case-by-case basis.**

          <AccordionContent>
            **Objects are generated randomly based on Sui block hashes. There are no 'if' statements or other rules governing Object trait scarcity, which makes all Objects equally rare. As of this writing, Objects are made up of:**

            **backgrounds (2)bodies (30)accessories (140)heads (242)glasses (23)**

          <AccordionContent>
            **Objects are stored directly on Sui and do not utilize pointers to other networks such as IPFS. This is possible because Object parts are compressed and stored on-chain using a custom run-length encoding (RLE), which is a form of lossless compression.**

            **The compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG image on-chain. To accomplish this, each part is decoded into an intermediate format before being converted into a series of SVG reactions using batched, on-chain string concatenation. Once the entire SVG has been generated, it is base64 encoded.**

          <AccordionTrigger>Object Seeder Contract</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            **The Object Seeder contract is used to determine Object traits during the minting process. The seeder contract can be replaced to allow for future trait generation algorithm upgrades. Additionally, it can be locked by the Objects DAO to prevent any future updates. Currently, Object traits are determined using pseudo-random number generation:**

            ```
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(blockhash(block.number - 1), nounId))
            ```

            **Trait generation is not truly random. Traits can be predicted when minting a Object on the pending block.**

            **[@](https://twitter.com/cryptoseneca)web3henry**

            **Because 100% of Object auction proceeds are sent to Objects DAO, Objecters have chosen to compensate themselves with Objects. Every 10th Object for the first 5 years of the project (Object ids #0, #10, #20, #30, and so on) will be automatically sent to the Objecter's multisig to be vested and shared among the founding members of the project.**

            **Objecter distributions don't interfere with the cadence of 1-hour auctions. Objects are sent directly to the Objecter's Multisig, and auctions continue on schedule with the next available Object ID.**
